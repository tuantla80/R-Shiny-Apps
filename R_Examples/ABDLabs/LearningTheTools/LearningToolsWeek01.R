# Command line

2+2

log(42)

sqrt(4)

4^3

(1/(sqrt(2 * pi * (3.1)^2))) * exp(-(12-10.7)^2/(2*3.1))

#In the formula above, pi is 3.1415...., and the exp() function raises the base
#of the natural log (e = 2.78...) to the power of the value in the argument.

# Comments

# Functions
log(4, base = 10)

# Defining variables

x <- 4
x + 3

x <- 32
